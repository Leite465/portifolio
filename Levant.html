                Persistent multiplayer campaign created using the DCT framework made for the military flight
                simulator DCS World, the server grew to become one most popular experience on the community thanks
                to its innovative gameplay and
                mission design, spearheading innovation and change on the multiplayer scene of the simulator. The
                server is kept running 24 hours every day, only stopped briefly to restart due to performance
                concerns. The campaign
                features a set of randomized events and tasks, which can be requested by the user at any moment, a
                "tickets" system, adding value to user life and ensuring that death has an effect on the entirety of
                the team by
                lowering the amount of respawns available to all players upon a player's death, dynamic enemies that
                react to the user's every move, ensuring a diverse experience and allowing for many different ways
                to approach
                one single problem to be formulated by the user, therefore introducing an element of planning, logic
                and decision making in the mission, but also allowing the user to never feel as if they are
                currently being
                drastically outnumbered.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Mission design</h3><br>
            <p>
                I'm responsible for the bulk of content being created and introduced on the campaign, with more
                than 200 handmade missions, several being under several revisions to bring them to a gold
                standard. The main objetive is to
                immerse the player by achieving a balance between realism and fun, all missions are made with
                different playstyles in mind, as well taking into consideration the community feedback.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The missions are separated into different mission categories, including but not limited to
                Strike, Close Air Support, Battlefield Air Interdiction. Those mission pools, are made to their
                respective real life counterparts,
                and they are also all limited to certain aircraft which historically performed such missions
                during the campaign time period(late 1980s). Each mission inside a set category is made to be
                balanced around the
                airframes that have that kind of mission available, but even then, for the most time, there's a
                big diversity of aircraft for every mission type, so special though must still be given, so
                lesser capable equipment
                could also be viable, which is one of the selling points of the campaign.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                There was a heavy thought on incentives for team work and creative approach, by employing
                inteligent design, you can create situations where players can succeed in solo play but thrive
                in coordination, sometimes by making
                solo play viable but cooperation more efficient, as well by making an enemy AI system that
                always works in groups or with the creation of objectives that are hard to tackle alone such as
                air defenses as two players doesn't
                necessarily mean more guns on a target, but rather, different equipment which allows a creative
                and varied approach to missions. The idea was always to promote cooperation as the ideal way to
                go, whether spontaneous as a
                player performing aerial combat helping a fellow attack aircraft to not get shot down, or with
                friends joining the server together and planning a mission as an element. Another form of
                cooperation is in form of SEAD(Supression
                of Enemy Air Defenses) missions, which makes the campaign easier to everyone by eliminating a
                threat capable to denying entire areas.

                Consideration was also put into mission placement around the map, as to give players varied
                terrain, which can give options for the approach, as well taking into consideration the
                campaign flow and also play into the
                cooperation mindset, as the example shows, a well placed SEAD mission, can cover another
                mission, which ties to the previously mentioned cooperative play incentives, as a player can
                run those missions and eliminate
                the threat so other aicraft can safely fly over the region.
                <br><br>

                Also notable, is the objective placement for the mission shown on the image, being more than
                one target, and set in a way that players would not be able to complete in a single attack
                run, it ties on the design elements
                mentioned earlier, as to make cooperation a better way to approach a mission, without giving
                the option for solo play, as some players may rather playing solo, or simply join during a
                time of low player counts.
                <br><br>

                And lastly, there's a lot of missions with lasting effects on the whole campaign, such as
                opening new resupply points, or denying AI spawn points for the enemy team, and so, weight
                is given to mission players can accept
                thus giving them a sense of importance to the player, as well making the campaign more
                dynamic and engaging.
